@interface ViewController : UIViewController

// Hook up text field into code
// Property: anything that tells us about objects
// Like, how many legs a table has, what someone's height is
// Properties can be applied to anything
//
// nonatomic: that in a threading scenario, this property will become a little bit slower
// weak: it is for memory management.
// automatic memory management introduced in 2010/2011
// IBOutlet is to connect to the screen?
// the last part, behind the *, can be anything
// You are expressing what the textfield on the screen is
// the * is saying that it is a reference type. (* is called static)
